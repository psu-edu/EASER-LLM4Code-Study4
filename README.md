## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with a short description, 2-3 sentences in length, of the specific sustainability problem your solution is meant to address.

### How our technology solution can help

REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with a short description of your team's solution, in about 10 words.

### Our idea

INSTRUCTIONS: Replace this paragraph with a longer description of your solution. In about 500 words, describe your solution in more detail. Include the real-world problem you identified, describe the technological solution you have created, and explain how itâ€™s an improvement over existing solutions. You can supply additional documentation in this source code repository that you link to as well.

More detail is available in our [description document](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md).
