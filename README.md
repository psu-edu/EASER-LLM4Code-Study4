_INSTRUCTIONS: Below are the suggested sections to include in your README file to make sure your project is well documented. You can remove this instruction text._

## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with a short description, 2-3 sentences in length, of the specific sustainability problem your solution is meant to address.

### How our technology solution can help

REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with a short description of your team's solution, in about 10 words.

### Our idea

INSTRUCTIONS: Replace this paragraph with a longer description of your solution. In about 500 words, describe your solution in more detail. Include the real-world problem you identified, describe the technological solution you have created, and explain how itâ€™s an improvement over existing solutions. You can supply additional documentation in this source code repository that you link to as well.

More detail is available in our [description document](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md).

## Technology implementation

### IBM watsonx product(s) used

_INSTRUCTIONS: Included here is a list of IBM watsonx products. Remove any products you did not use. Leave only those included in your solution code. In your official submission on the Call for Code Global Challenge web site, you are required to provide details on where and how you used each IBM watsonx product so judges can review your implementation. Remove these instructions._

**Featured watsonx products**

- [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [watsonx.governance](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [watsonx Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watsonx-assistant) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

### Other IBM technology used

INSTRUCTIONS: List any other IBM technology or IBM AI services used in your solution and describe how each component was used. If you can provide details on where these were used in your code, that would help the judges review your submission.

**Additional IBM AI services (Remove any that you did not use)**

- [Watson Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Watson Studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-studio) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Language Translator](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/language-translator) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

### Solution architecture

REPLACE THIS EXAMPLE WITH YOUR OWN, OR REMOVE THIS EXAMPLE

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:

![Video transcription/translaftion app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Presentation materials

_INSTRUCTIONS: The following deliverables should be officially posted to your My Team > Submissions section of the [Call for Code Global Challenge resources site](https://cfc-prod.skillsnetwork.site/), but you can also include them here for completeness. Replace the examples seen here with your own deliverable links._
